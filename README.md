This repository provide code for generating figures to compose the SMME schematic plot (Fig. 1B in mortality paper):

1. plot_GMT_pdf.py is the python code for generating PDF of global mean surface temperature anomaly.

2. plot_tas_aggregation_annual_GCP.py is the python code for generating world maps of surface temperature anomaly in impact regions.
